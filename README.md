# Alabool
### Proyecto desarrollado para la clase Aplicaciones Web en 7mo semestre de la carrera
The project is developed with a user view in Angular. It's set in production mode.

There's a database in MongoDB, the app stores the data from "Knowledgebase" locally in MongoDB.

It has an API generated with Loopback 3. Loopback gets the Userlike API (through a token) and a JSON from Firebase that simulates the Openbravo API.
## Prerequisites
### Node:
Use node -v and npm -v in your terminal to verify you have the latest version of Node and Node Package Manager.
### Angular
Verify through ng -v if you have it, if not use npm install @angular/cli -g to install the latest version.
### MongoDB
If you don't have Mongo, visit https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/ and install it depending on your machine.
