### Proyecto desarrollado para la clase Aplicaciones Web en 7mo semestre de la carrera
The project is developed with a user view in Angular. It's set in production mode.

There's a database in MongoDB, the app stores the data from "Knowledgebase" locally in MongoDB.

It has an API generated with Loopback. Loopback gets the Userlike API (through a token) and a JSON from Firebase that simulates the Openbravo API.

After downloading the project, open your terminal, go to the directory and use npm install.
